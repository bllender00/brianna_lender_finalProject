            <h1>Evolution of Nintendo</h1>
            <p class="intro">As one of the most tenured games and entertainment companies, Nintendo has quite the history. It started as a humble playing-card company in the late 1800s but ended up saving the video game industry from a financial crash in the early 1980s. Since then, Nintendo has had an illustrious history and has gone on to become arguably the most important console manufacturer of all time. Below you can find details on the companys console hardware highlights.</p>
            <p class="intro">You can browse through the timeline by pressing the <b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN</b> arrow keys, gently <b>scrolling</b> or <b>clicking</b> the different dots to the left. </p>

                <p>The first thing Nintendo came out with was a deck of playing cards. It became quite famous quite quick. This shows that Nintendo is not just a company of video games and consoles. It was quite basic but it was the beginning.</p>

                <p>The NES helped revitalize the North American video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. The system's use of interchangeable cartridges allowed other companies to produce and manufacture games for the system. However, Nintendo would only allow this on their terms and be applied to their future consoles.</p>

A RAM adapter cartridge, included with the Disk System, contained the disk drive controller as well as extra RAM required for game operation.

                <p>One of the most noteworthy features of the handheld is the ability of the upper screen to display 3D without the need for glasses in a technique known as autostereoscopy. The system has motion and gyroscopic detection for interactivity with the games and apps that use movement of the system, and features a new analog circle control, referred to by Nintendo as a 'Circle Pad', a first for a Nintendo handheld.</p>

The main controller features a 6.2-inch touch screen which can stream content from the console, allowing for playing away from TV, as well as asymmetrical gameplay.</p>

                <p>A slightly smaller revision of the Wii as well as the third and final model in the Wii family. Multiple features have been removed in order to reduce the price. The Wii Mini only supports composite cables, and it cannot output 480p. The Wii Mini has a modified version of the Wii Channel Menu, with multiple menus from the settings removed as a result of the Wii Mini's missing features.</p>

                <p>The Nintendo 2DS is a redesign of the Nintendo 3DS, which uses mostly the same software, but differs in physical design. It features a more solid, tablet-like design. So it can't fold up like a Nintendo DS/3DS, and as such, it cannot be paused by folding it up. Instead, it has a Sleep switch in the bottom right-hand corner. It has one mono speaker on the top left, which is a first for the Nintendo DS/3DS line of systems. It has a single touch screen, but the casing creates the illusion of two screens, and plastic covers the top screen area to prevent it from being touched.</p>
